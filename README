# slang

slang is a mini "language" for me to test out ways to create a script/programming language in C/C++

# instruction

currently (as of 2024-10-21) slang does not take arguments or read files, instead only reading STDIN until EOF (^D). you can feed in your program line by line and end it with CTRL+D, or do what i do:

```
cat src/program.sl | slang
```
